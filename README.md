## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (SASS)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to dynamically show and hide content in different ways using JavaScript, how to apply styles conditionally, and how to use SASS variables and mixins to reuse code efficiently. Additionally, I learned how to add content to elements like paragraphs using JavaScript, which improved the user interaction and functionality of the component.

### Continued development

For future improvements, I would like to:

- Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
- Implement a system to save ratings and display average feedback.
